We do not collect or store any personal data, including photos, beyond the time necessary for the functionality of the app. The only access we request is permission to upload and process the photos for generating quotes.</p>

        <h2>2. Use of Data</h2>
        <p>The photos uploaded by users are solely used to generate the requested content (quotes) for social media. We do not use this data for any other purposes.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
        <p>Uploaded photos are processed temporarily to generate the quotes and are not stored on our servers. Once the processing is complete, the photos are discarded, and no data is retained.</p>
